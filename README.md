## Description
> Within months, COVID-19 went from an epidemic to a pandemic. From the first identified case in December 2019, how did the virus spread so fast and widely? In this free R project, we will visualize data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to see how this virus grew to be a global pandemic.  
> 
> This project assumes you can manipulate data frames using `dplyr` and make plots using `ggplot2`.
